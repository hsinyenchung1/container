## Host App for Micro-Frontends (MFEs)

This repository serves as a host application designed to integrate and test Micro-Frontends (MFEs) in a consolidated environment. It aims to streamline the development and testing processes, allowing developers to ensure the compatibility, interoperability, and functionality of MFEs before deploying them into production or other environments.

## Key Features
MFE Importer: It provides a modular architecture where you can dynamically import MFEs, simulating the behavior of a full-scale, integrated application.

Testing Environment: It acts as a secure sandbox for you to test individual or multiple MFEs, monitor their interactions, debug issues, and validate fixes.

Deployment Preview: It gives developers the opportunity to preview the deployment of MFEs, ensuring seamless integration with the main application and other micro-frontends.

Performance Tracking: This repository is designed to help track the performance of MFEs, identifying potential bottlenecks or performance issues before they affect the live environment.

## Use Cases
Developers looking to simulate an integrated environment to test their MFEs.
Project managers seeking to preview the deployment of micro-frontends before actual implementation.
Software teams aiming to improve the overall quality and performance of their MFEs by conducting pre-deployment tests.
